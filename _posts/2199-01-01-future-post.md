We've generated test scenarios based on the geometry and topology information extracted from the HD maps, either without or with dynamic obstacles. 

Our methods thus suffers from a intrinsic limitation, which is the limitation of the HD map itself. 

If the HD maps are limited, the types of scenarios generated by whichever methods will be fundamentally limited.

For example, if there are no junctions in the map, we will not be able to generate any junction scenarios.

To address this issue and complement the previously proposed methods, we propose the following feature-based HD map generation method to automatically generate HD maps ready for simulation testing based on manually required features or automatically extracted features from existing maps.
