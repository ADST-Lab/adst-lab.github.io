Introduction

<p>The <b>Autonomous Driving Simulation Tests </b>use a variety of simulation techniques to test autonomous driving technologies in multiple dimensions. Simulation testing is a basic key technology for autonomous driving R&D. Compared with the real road test, which has high cost, many restrictions and low efficiency, virtual simulation system can provide richer and more diverse static environments and continuous dynamic random traffic flow, which can effectively increase the frequency and density of high test/training value scenes within the limited virtual test mileage, and it has become the common demand for the research and development of automated driving systems by most domestic and foreign enterprises.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, <b><font color='#ff6a00'>Alibaba Autonomous Driving Lab</font></b> has been committed to the development and testing of autonomous driving technology, with outstanding achievements. Currently, our research interests are as follows:</p>
* <b>Autonomous driving data mining and clustering
* <b>Simulation scenario modeling and generation
* <b>Safety scenario analysis and reconstruction
* <b>Fault injection and adversarial attacks
* <b>Accelerated longtail scenario generation
* <b>Interactive scenario generation

We sincerely hope that more scholars and knowledgeable people will join our team and work together to promote the development of autonomous driving technology. If you are interested in this program, please contact <b><font color='#ff6a00'>kairui.ykr@alibaba-inc.com</font></b>.

> As the first high-speed autonomous driving simulation Challenge in China, the competetion relies on the powerful Ali Cloud infrastructure "Cloud efficient car training", attracted more than 1,500 teams to participate, with master and Bo accounting for 15% and C9 universities accounting for 56%. One of the top judges in the autonomous driving industry and a number of professors from prestigious universities.

The Autopilot Simulation Competition provides multiple traffic test scenarios for the participating teams under the simulation environment, which cover common high-speed scenarios and include real accident scenarios with good typicality and generalization value. It mainly tests the decision-making ability of automatic driving vehicles in various complex traffic environments, and participants can train and evaluate the algorithmic ability of the intelligent body through the Ali simulation platform.

<b>First Highway Intersection HD-Map Dataset: Matrix Flyover</b>

<img src="../images/shujuji3.png">

<a href="https://ntutangyun.github.io/highway-interchange-dataset-website/">Matrix Flyover</a>, a high precision map simulation dataset of high-speed hubs in China, was developed by Alibaba and Nanyang Technological in Singapore. In view of the large amount of testing required for 160,000 km expressway in China and the high cost of high-precision map generation, it is difficult to solve the problem of test generalization. The simulation map data set of high-speed hub is constructed based on simulation generation.

At present, there are 1443 HD Maps, based on Hangzhou real data generalization generation, support mainstream formats (open drive & sumo & apollo), parameter sampling and generalization in line with highway junction design specifications. This Dataset filled the gap of the lack of real and high precision and generalization of hdmap in the industry, and provided the basis for the subsequent map-based construction of more abundant scene library and related automatic driving research. The relevant results were published in the robot top meeting ICRA 2023, [see details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12738).
